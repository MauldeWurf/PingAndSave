# PingAndSave
small powershell script to ping 255 LAN IPs
I started this script to find the IP Adresses of a few Power via LAN adapters in our local network.

To use it the script can be copied to Windows PowerShell line by line (not recommanded) or can be run directly after changing the script policy with an admin account using:> Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
